Access2Base is a LibreOffice/OpenOffice extension for (business or personal) application developers and advanced users.
It provides a LibO/AOO Basic library of macros mainly inspired by VBA for MSAccess and its object model.
The library is much more intuitive and easy to learn than the standard UNO API.

Documentation is available in the Basic IDE (Help menu) or on http://www.access2base.com.
